# REZ P3 - The app you need

This project is a web application developped with NodeJS, Bower, Firebase and AngularJS. It is proposed for Arts et MÃ©tiers students in Paris, living in the school residence. It allows users to have news feed, every day life in paris tips, but also to interact with the students association.


## How to contribute

To get you started you can simply clone this repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

This app use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test ue-rez. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.


## Development 

This app is still under development. What remaining to do is :
* configure administration authentication
* fill database with "real" information
